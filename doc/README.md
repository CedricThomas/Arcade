# Cpp_Arcade Group Compliance

We use our promotion [github specification](https://github.com/EPITECH-Strasbourg-2021/CPP-Arcade-Spec) and we participate to the development. CÃ©dric write the first version of the specification before the upload on github and since it Nicolas Polomack improved a lot of things. So technically we are compliant with every group who use this specification. We worked in collaboration with the group of Chris Jungen, Arthur Knoepflin, and Remi Wickuler to assure our full compliance.
